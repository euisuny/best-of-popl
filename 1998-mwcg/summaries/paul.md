# From System F to Typed Assembly Language

## Summary

The paper details a compiler from System F to a Typed Assembly Language. 

## Questions/notes

- They discuss languages with typed IRs, but they all drop types at some point. I suppose TAL is in some sense at the bottom of the stack, but even still some translations must be performed to go to a real assembly langauge. Should we consider TAL to also be some sort of IR?
- The paper is pretty bare-bones. I wish there was more context, but maybe that's because this was the first work in this area?
