It's Compcert! It seems to mostly be about describing the various intermediate languages they go through and their operational semantics. I can't say that I looked at them closely enough to understand them. In fact, I can say for sure that I haven't!! Also apparently this version of Compcert uses inductive semantics and those can only express guarantees about terminating programs. Thats pretty lame, using inductive relations for semantics is lame. Coinduction 4 lyf.
