* Summary
  
I found this paper hard to grok. My rough understanding of the paper
is that they want to use "regions" which are inferred statically in
order to determine when to free memory...

* Comments

  - This is a paper written by absolute monsters who use œÅ, p, r, and
    slightly different r all to mean distinct but related things.
  - For the love of god just say $x \in BLAH$ instead of giving me
    another variable ranging over "denumerably infinite" sets.
  - Did everybody lose self-esteem after SPJ and Philip Wadler won
    POPL the previous year?
