A type in JFlow includes a Java type and a label, which represents permission
to access information from program variables.  Each statement has a
program-counter label (pc), which is used to check implicit flow (information
flow through control flow).

JFlow has run-time labels.  Since labels are stored in variables (which have
labels), a label variable represents a label and contains a (possibly
different) label.

Classes can be parameterized by labels.  Subtyping is invariant in label
paremeters, meaning that {L1} \sqsubseteq {L2} does to imply T[{L1}] \leq
T[{L2}].
