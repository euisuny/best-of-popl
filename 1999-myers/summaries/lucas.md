## Summary

I don't know much about privacy models nor do I have much time to read this, so let's see how this goes! Some nice properties that I can appreciate are label polymorphism, so you can write code uninterested in security and use it as liberally as allowed. Label inference is cool. Some things I don't understand is who intuitively are the principals. If I am thinking about privacy, I imagine there are administrators and users who all have some information they want to selectively share, but that seems external to the language. It seems like a process is a principal, but is that a notion like a thread? Anyway, this is as much as I feel like writing.
