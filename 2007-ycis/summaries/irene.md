Provably correct JavaScript security -- (1) a core operational semantics, (2) an embedding of "callbacks" in instrumented code to deal with higher-order scripts, and 
(3) security policies expressed as edit automata.

Reminds me also of this paper : https://ranjitjhala.github.io/static/staged_information_flow_for_javascript.pdf (Staged Information Flow for JavaScript)

Probably really stupid question: what is program instrumentation?
