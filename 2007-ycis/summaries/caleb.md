(Review of the abstract)

This paper is about formally modelling and intercepting interaction between the browser, JavaScript code, and the user.
It looks like it was an important milestone in web security.
Some questions I have:

- How does this relate to TypeScript?

- How has JavaScript evolved over time? Do these techniques still apply today?

- Fundamentally, what is the right approach to browser security?
  Provocative Q: Are browsers and the internet simply inherently insecure?
