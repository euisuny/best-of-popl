The paper describes a method for enforcing JavaScript security policies by
instrumenting the JavaScript code. The authors define a subset of JavaScript,
called CoreScript, for which they define a semantics, and an instrumentation
procedure (they also have a "mostly straightforward" extension of these
semantics and the instrumentation to JavaScript). They prove that code
instrumented using a security policy will respect that policy, and they show
experimentally that their method provides client-side protection against
cross-site scripting, spammed pop-up windows, and malicious redirects.
