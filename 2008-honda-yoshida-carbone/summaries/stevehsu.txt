The paper presents multi-party asynchronous session types.
It first defines global types for sessions,
which describe all participants' interactions,
rather than just describing the interactions pairwise
or just the activities of one process.
(It can then project these global types onto each participant
to recover local views of the protocol.)
This presentation more naturally expresses multi-party protocols.
