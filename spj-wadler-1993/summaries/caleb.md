=== PLEASE DO NOT READ: AWFUL HASTILY WRITTEN GARBAGE SUMMARY ===

Monads: represent programs with side-effects (e.g. IO) in a purely functional language!
The key points of this new system are that it is
- Simple to work with both from programmer and implementer's point of view;
- It's composable, extensible, and efficient
- Not necessarily that it is more expressive than existing systems, fundamentally.

Some questions:
- Where does this paper fit in the history of Haskell? What was Haskell before monads?
- How does this relate to the problem of lazy I/O, that researchers have admitted was
  a mistake in Haskell?
