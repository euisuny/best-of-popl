# Anytime, Anywhere: Modal Logics for Mobile Ambients

## Summary

Modal logic is amazing!!!

Basically this paper is about defining a modal logic which is both temporal and spatial (in contrast to temporal logic, where possible worlds are only organized in time and not in space). Space is hierarchical: there are different locations, which have sublocations, and so on.

The paper gives a lot more formal detail, as well as gives some formal deductions in this modal logic and ideas for applications, which I didn't read in detail.

The interest at the time (and the influence of the paper) seems to have been to model a notion of *mobility* of computations, which was thought to be a good way of thinking about distributed systems, and in particular distributed systems security.

## Questions

Q1. Today, people don't really talk about "mobility". Is this a concept that ultimately failed to live up to its potential, or just something that we know by different names today?

Q2. I would be interested in specific applications of this modal logic to systems, in particular, to modeling and proving some of the security properties in distributed computations that the authors were interested in. Is there any follow-up work that was successful in that direction?

Q3. (A bit provocative) Are modal logics powerful enough to model real systems, or are they just in general too expressively limited?
