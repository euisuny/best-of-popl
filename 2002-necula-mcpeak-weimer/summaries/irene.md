# CCured

short notes

- follows similar principles to "soft typing".
- static and runtime checks for memory safety, introducing a more refined type
  system than C
- notion of "physical subtyping" based on dynamic allocation
- typecasts verified using run-time info
- this always makes me tilted: "The type void is equivalent to an empty struct
  type"
