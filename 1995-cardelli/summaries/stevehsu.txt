lexically scoped, object oriented, distributed

Sites are address spaces. As such, they contain memory locations, which in
turn can hold values. Threads have the usual definition. Identifiers can be
constants or variables (references). Values can be objects, arrays, closures,
or basic values (integers, strings). Closures can be transmitted over the
network as program text together with a table giving values to the free
identifiers in the text. This table enables distributed lexical scoping.

definition of objects and their operations

An expression containing an object o is a "self-inflicted operation" on o if o
is the host object of the current method. Operations that are not
self-inflicted are said to be external. A protected object cannot be
externally updated, cloned, or aliased. A serialized object requires all
external operations to hold a mutex. Two Obliq sites can communicate by
sharing objects through a name server.
