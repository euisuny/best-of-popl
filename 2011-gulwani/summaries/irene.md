# Automating String Processing in Spreadsheets Using Input-Output Examples

The Flash Fill Paper. An excellent case of using synthesis techniques to a widely used application.
Fully automated, real time, easy interaction, fast convergence, with noise handling! Wowza. Gulwani presents an algorithm for synthesizing programs given input-output examples, which is proved sound and conjectured to be complete. The focus on usability is notable, and is an integral part of the motivation and evaluation of this work.

Spreadsheet programming continues to be incredibly painful. The façade of “ease” that Excel claims to have often feels like a scam. It’s strictly worse than databases for storing information in the long-term, and for any meaningful forms of calculating things I’ve often had to write scripts mixed with nasty spreadsheet programming. Its worst part, probably, is the fragility (in that it is difficult to write modular scripts) and “unsafeness” of spreadsheet programming. I think it would be cute and more pleasant to use  a spreadsheet programming language with a dimension/unit-tracking type system. (I would imagine someone has already done this..) 

The use of the word “inductive” in “Inductive program synthesis” was not what I expected it to be.

How do people find what a “good problem domain” for program synthesis is? It never seems like the goal is for such tools to generate whole programs. But we can’t provide synthesis tools ad nauseam, right? (Or can we?)

What are the pressing challenges with program synthesis nowadays? It seems like there has been a lot of recent efforts to use program synthesis along with deep learning. What are the limits to this approach? 

Are there any proof repair tools that use program synthesis?
