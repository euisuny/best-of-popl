# best-of-popl

Welcome to BOP (Best of POPL).

Our goal is to ask *fun*damental questions about the principles of programming languages, by looking at the ["Most Influential Papers"](https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/POPL/) from POPL. To encourage discussion and participation, weâ€™re mandating a rule for every reading group member to write up a short memoir (*2~3 paragraphs, including a cursory overview with nibbles of thoughts and questions*) of the reading for every meeting. This repository is the home for our memoirs.

**When? Where?**: Approximately Every other Wednesday at 10am. ~~Levine basement (057).~~ **Online on Zoom.**
