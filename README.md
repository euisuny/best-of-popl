# best-of-popl
Welcome to BOP (Best of POPL). 

Our goal is to ask *fundamental* questions about the principles of programming languages, by looking at the [“Most Influential Papers”](https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/POPL/) from POPL. To encourage discussion and participation, we’re mandating a rule for every reading group member to write up a short memoir (*2~3 paragraphs, including a cursory overview with nibbles of thoughts and questions*) of the reading for every meeting.


**When? Where?**: Every other Wednesday at 10am. Levine 612. 

## Meetings
* *Jan 28th, 2020* : S.P Jones, P. Wadler. **Imperative Functional Programming** (1993).
