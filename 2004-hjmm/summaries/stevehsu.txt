The paper introduces a technique that can be used in the abstraction
refinement step of counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR).
Given a spurious counterexample, the paper uses a proof of infeasibility to
produce predicates useful for refuting the counterexample together with
program locations where the predicates are relevant to the analysis.

How difficult is it to write program specifications in their logic, which
according to section 3 seems to be FOL with linear inequalities?
Are there reasonable program specifications that can't be written in this
logic?
