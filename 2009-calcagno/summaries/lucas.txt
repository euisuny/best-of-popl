So it looks like the general idea of this paper is to use biabduction to infer separation logic predicates for a static analysis of large C programs.
Abduction seems to be the process of figuring out what extra assumptions you need in order to infer a target proposition. Biaduction seems to mean that you are assuming both extra assumptions and goals  but this is simplified by the whole separtion of the store thing.
It introduces the concept of anti-frames (missing portions of the state) to complement frames (portions of the state not touched by an operation).
Many of the example specifications seem to effectively be types.
